Natural Language Processing(NLP) Zero to Hero

I finished this course "Zero to Hero for Natural Language Processing using TensorFlow" offered by official "Tensorflow" instructed by the developer advocate of Tensorflow, Laurence Moroney. I did this course on youtube and these are the codes I wrote while attending the course. 
Each notebook is a topic that was covered in the course and the 4 topics are,  

1. Tokenization:
           In this first lesson I learned to represent words in a way that a computer can process them, Basically how to tokenize words using TensorFlowâ€™s tools. 
           This was done with a view to later training a neural network to understand their meaning. 

2. Sequencing - Turning sentences into data:
            In this lesson, I took the next step after the TOKENIZATION. Which is creating sequences of numbers from your sentences, and using tools to process them to
            make them ready for teaching neural networks.

3. Training a model to recognize sentiment in text:
            In the last few lessons, I basically learned how to preprocess the data before feeding it to  our model. In this lesson, I learned how to build a
            classifier model to recognize sentiment in text.

4. ML with Recurrent Neural Networks:
            In this lesson, I learned about the theory of recurrent neural networks and how it works and as well as implementation of a RNN.
            I later built a model using recurrent neural networks and LSTMs and training it on the lyrics to traditional Irish songs and later made it to write a
            similiar styled poem using those words.
